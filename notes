radius
angle
start at center point
end at extension of radius


use an adjusting right triangle to calculate the circumference
the radius of the circle becomes the hypotenuse of the right triangle

the use of sine and cosine can be used to "move" the radius around

the angle can be used for discovering the x and y positions
therefore:

	radius = 4
	angle = 30

	y = radius * sin( angle )
	x = radius * cos( angle )

javascript evaluates sin, cos and tan with radians, so Math.PI / 180 should be used.
